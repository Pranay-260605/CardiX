# ü©ª CardiX - Chest X-Ray Diagnosis with Deep Learning

**CardiX** is an AI-powered diagnostic tool that classifies chest X-ray images into four categories: **COVID-19**, **Normal**, **Pneumonia**, and **Lung Opacity**. It uses a custom-built deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and features a responsive frontend and backend for real-time medical image analysis.

## üìö Datasets Used

CardiX uses data aggregated from the following publicly available sources:

1. [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
2. [Chest X-ray: COVID19, Pneumonia, Normal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia)

> Both datasets were cleaned and balanced before training.
